I can write instructions about managing the website here. As of 7/27/2014, I have forgotten what files need to be changed.


The _config.yml file is the most important file. If there is something here thatyou don't understand, you can give this file to ChatGPT to explain it to you.

In _data/navigation.yml file you can see the links that appear on the website.

The _pages folder seems most important. The files where important text lies are about.md, blog.md, cv.md, projects.md, publications.md, research.md

The _posts folder contains samples of blog posts.
