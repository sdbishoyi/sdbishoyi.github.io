I can see the links that appear on the website.

******************************************* The _pages folder ***************************************************

In this folder, the files that contain important text are about.md, blog.md, cv.md, projects.md, publications.md, research.md

markdown.md located in _pages/ is important.

A standard format for a commit message in this repo could be "what changed in which file". This format can be changed in the future if necessary.

proposed change : 1. The font appearing at the top of the page in the horizontal bar has to be made bigger. It goes as Som Dev Bishoyi ... Research ... Publications etc

2. Include "Teaching" section in the header
