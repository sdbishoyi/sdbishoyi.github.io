Abstract: Several theoretical and astrophysical problems
---including gravitational-wave modeling for extreme
mass-ratio inspirals--- require accurate time-domain
solutions of the spin-weight $s=-2$ Teukolsky equation in
Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. Because such simulations are
performed on finite computational domains, they typically
introduce an artificial outer boundary where nontrivial
boundary conditions must be imposed. If these conditions
are inaccurate, then spurious reflections and slowly-growing
unphysical modes may corrupt long-time evolutions. We
develop and implement exact radiation outer boundary
conditions for the Bardeen-Press equation (a 
harmonic moment of the $a=0$ Teukolsky equation), 
making the artificial boundary transparent at any finite
radius. We also construct near-to-far field teleportation
kernels that map field data recorded at finite radius $r_1$
to the data reaching $r_2 > r_1$. The possible choice
$r_2 = \infty$ corresponds to asymptotic waveform evaluation,
that is propagation of the data to future null infinity. We
show that both boundary and teleportation kernels are well
approximated by exponential sums, with associated error
bounds. Implemented in a time-domain solver, our kernel-based
boundary conditions eliminate unphysical late-time growth
and give the correct late-time decay rates, affording 
efficient long-duration simulations for waveform modeling
and related blackhole perturbation calculations.
