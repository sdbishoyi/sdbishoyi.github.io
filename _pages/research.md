# 1. Gravitational self-force in the time domain

## i. What is gravitational self-force(GSF)?

Gravitational self-force is an approach to the two-body problem in GR in which the smaller object's equation of motion is written perturbatively to model its non-geodesic motion in the spacetime produced by a much larger object.

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dp^{\alpha}}{d\tau} = \epsilon F_{1}^{\alpha}  + \epsilon^2 F_{2}^{\alpha} + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^3)
\end{align}
$$

## i. What are the wave-like equations in the context of BHPT

There are 3 wave-like equations in Black Hole perturbation theory. They are the Regge-Wheeler equation, the Zerilli equation and the Teukolsky equation.
