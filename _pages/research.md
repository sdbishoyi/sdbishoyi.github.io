# 1. Gravitational self-force in the time domain

## i. What is gravitational self-force(GSF)?

Gravitational self-force is an approach to the two-body problem in GR in which the smaller object's equation of motion is written perturbatively to model its non-geodesic motion in the spacetime produced by a much larger object.

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dp^{\alpha}}{d\tau} = \epsilon F_{1}^{\alpha}  + \epsilon^2 F_{2}^{\alpha} + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^3)
\end{align}
$$

# 2. Boundary conditions for wave-like equations in black hole perturbation theory(BHPT)

## i. What are the wave-like equations in the context of BHPT

There are 3 wave-like equations in Black Hole perturbation theory. They are the Regge-Wheeler equation, the Zerilli equation and the Teukolsky equation. The first two describe perturbations in the spacetime of Schwarzschild black holes, while the third describes perturbations of Kerr black holes.

# 3. Observational implications for Gravitational hair from extremal Kerr black holes

## i. What is hair in the context of black holes?

Rather than directly answering the question, it is easier to understand the no-hair theorem in general 
relativity. It states that a black hole is fully characterized by three parameters namely the mass, spin and charge. In that sense there are no other(independent) quantities that can distinguish between two black holes.
