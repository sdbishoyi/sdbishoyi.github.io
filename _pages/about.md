I am a doctoral fellow in the Engineering and Applied Sciences PhD program at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Before joining the PhD program, I have worked with Prof. Gaurav Khanna and Dr. Scott Field in the [U2GRC Group](https://web.uri.edu/gravity){:target="_blank"}.

I completed my integrated BS-MS degree at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata in may 2022, majoring in Physics and a minor in mathematics. 

I like teaching and has volunteered to teach several undergrad courses during my time at IISER Kolkata. In my free time, I like playing or watching football and cricket.
