# My Worldline

<!-- # About Me -->

As a **4th-year PhD candidate** in the Department of Mathematics at the **University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (UMass Dartmouth)**, I blend applied mathematics and scientific computing to tackle challenges in gravitational physics. My research centers on developing numerical methods to solve **partial differential equations** emerging from **Black Hole Perturbation Theory** and **Gravitational Self-Force**—tools essential for modeling the intricate dynamics of extreme cosmic events.

I'm proud to be part of the [U²GRC Group](https://web.uri.edu/gravity){:target="_blank"}, a dynamic collaboration between gravity research teams at UMass Dartmouth and the University of Rhode Island. This interdisciplinary hub fuels innovative work at the intersection of theory and computation.

Beyond the lab, I'm deeply passionate about teaching—both guiding students and continually learning myself. I've served as a teaching assistant for undergraduate courses including **Classical Mechanics I & II**, **Electrodynamics I**, and **Introduction to Computation**, where I've enjoyed sparking curiosity in physics and math.

In my downtime, I recharge with the thrill of football and cricket (both playing and spectating), serene hikes in nature, binge-watching movies and anime, and diving into biographies or historical narratives that illuminate the human story.

I'm actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities starting in **2027**—if your group aligns with numerical PDEs, Scientific computing, BHPT and gravitational self-force, I'd love to connect!
