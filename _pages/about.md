# My Worldline

Currently, I am a 3rd year PhD researcher at the University of Massachusetts(UMass) Dartmouth working on computational gravitational physics. I use numerical methods for solving partial differential equations that arise in Black Hole Perturbation theory.

I am a member of the [U<sup>2</sup>GRC Group](https://web.uri.edu/gravity){:target="_blank"} formed from the combination of gravity groups at UMass Dartmouth and University of Rhode Island.

I have a passion for teaching(both others and myself) and have thus far served as a teaching assistant for several undergrad courses such as Classical Mechanics I and II, Electrodynamics I and Introduction to Computation. In my free time, I like playing and watching football and cricket, meandering in a natural setting, watching movies/anime and reading biographies of people and historical accounts of past events.
